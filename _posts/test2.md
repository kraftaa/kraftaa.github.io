1. Datawarehouses
   Building a data warehouse is not just about storing data; it’s about efficiently managing, processing, and analyzing large volumes of information. Whether you’re building it from scratch or integrating an existing solution, there are key factors—security, performance, and operational complexity—that influence the design and success of your data warehouse architecture.

1.1 Security
Data security is the cornerstone of any successful data warehouse, especially in industries dealing with sensitive customer data or financial records. In our case, we prioritized both data integrity and privacy. When building an ETL pipeline, it was important to ensure that data was processed securely and couldn’t be tampered with or accessed without proper authorization.

Rust’s strong type safety ensured that data flows through the pipeline with precision and accuracy, helping to prevent issues such as SQL injection or data corruption. Using sqlx and Diesel, we could ensure that every SQL query was type-safe, preventing runtime errors that could expose the system to vulnerabilities.

But security goes beyond just type checking. We took additional steps to secure our data during transit and at rest. For instance, every interaction with our Postgres database was encrypted using SSL/TLS, which helped prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized access. Moreover, our S3 buckets were configured with encryption enabled for both data-at-rest and data-in-transit. This ensured that even if someone gained unauthorized access to the S3 bucket, the data would remain unreadable without the proper decryption keys.

We also implemented fine-grained access control. In the case of Postgres, we used role-based access control (RBAC) to limit which users could run specific queries, ensuring that only authorized personnel had the ability to modify or access sensitive data.

By pushing security to the edges—both in the ETL pipeline and the storage layer—we could confidently guarantee that our data warehouse adhered to industry standards for security and compliance.

1.2 Performance
Performance is critical when designing a data warehouse that handles petabytes of data. At the heart of our solution was the need for speed and scalability. Given the massive datasets we were processing, we needed an efficient way to extract, transform, and load data without consuming excessive resources or slowing down the pipeline.

Rust was a clear choice for handling performance-sensitive tasks. With its zero-cost abstractions and low-latency execution, Rust allowed us to develop a high-performance pipeline that could process data without the need for heavy memory usage or frequent garbage collection. Rust’s ownership model ensured that memory was allocated and deallocated efficiently, avoiding memory leaks and dangling pointers.

When processing data from Postgres, we used streaming techniques to load data incrementally rather than pulling the entire dataset into memory at once. By using sqlx, we could stream large result sets row-by-row, transforming the data on-the-fly. This approach greatly reduced the memory footprint and allowed us to process vast amounts of data without overwhelming the system.

For example, consider the case where we were processing customer orders. Instead of querying and storing all orders in memory at once, we used pagination to break the dataset into manageable chunks:

rust
Copy
Edit
let mut offset = 0;
let limit = 1000;

loop {
let query = format!("SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT {} OFFSET {}", limit, offset);
let orders: Vec<Order> = sqlx::query_as(&query)
.fetch_all(&pool)
.await?;

    if orders.is_empty() {
        break;
    }

    // Process the orders
    offset += limit;
}
This allowed us to handle large volumes of data without overburdening memory. Moreover, concurrent processing of these chunks, through Rust’s async/await paradigm, further optimized the pipeline by processing multiple chunks in parallel, leveraging multi-core systems efficiently.

Additionally, we parallelized tasks within the ETL pipeline to increase throughput. For instance, while one task was fetching data, another could be transforming it, and yet another could be writing it to S3. This non-blocking model helped ensure that each component of the pipeline operated in parallel, maximizing CPU usage and reducing total processing time.

1.3 Operational Complexity
Data pipelines, particularly cloud-native solutions, need to balance ease of operation with performance and scalability. We wanted to ensure that our data warehouse could scale as needed without overwhelming our operations team with constant maintenance.

One of the key strategies we adopted to manage operational complexity was containerization using Kubernetes. By containerizing the entire ETL process, from fetching data to writing it to S3, we achieved consistent environments across different stages of development, staging, and production. Kubernetes provided us with auto-scaling, allowing us to easily scale up our resources during peak loads and scale down when not needed, optimizing both costs and resource usage.

Moreover, we used Cargo workspaces to organize the project into separate but connected components. This helped us keep dependencies clean and manageable, as each module within the workspace could have its own set of dependencies, yet still work together seamlessly. Cargo also allowed us to parallelize the compilation process, which significantly reduced build times, especially as the project grew in size and complexity.

Another important aspect was error handling. With Rust’s strict type system and error handling mechanisms, we were able to catch errors at compile time rather than during execution. This drastically reduced the chance of runtime exceptions, ensuring that most problems were resolved during the development process itself. For instance, when fetching data from Postgres, Rust's type safety ensured that only valid columns were queried, preventing mismatches and erroneous results.

However, as with any system, we also faced operational pain points, such as dealing with the rapid pace of changes in the Rust ecosystem. Every time Rust released a new version, we had to ensure that all our dependencies were compatible, which occasionally caused delays. But these challenges were outweighed by the robustness and performance benefits that Rust provided.

2. Maybe Rust is a Good Choice?
   Selecting the right technology is one of the most important decisions when designing a data pipeline. In this section, we’ll walk through why Rust became our language of choice for building an efficient, secure, and scalable ETL pipeline.

2.1 The Context: Why Not Spark or DBT?
When we set out to build our ETL pipeline, we considered multiple options, including well-established tools like Spark and DBT. However, both presented significant challenges for our specific use case.

Spark, although powerful, is built on the JVM and requires substantial resources for setup and operation. For example, memory consumption in Spark can be high, and we didn’t want to deal with the complexity of managing a JVM-based cluster just for ETL tasks. Additionally, batch processing in Spark, while efficient for some use cases, didn’t align with our need for real-time processing of data streams.

On the other hand, DBT is an excellent tool for SQL-based transformations, but it didn’t offer the flexibility and performance that we needed for our use case. DBT excels in orchestrating SQL-based transformations in a data warehouse but falls short when it comes to custom logic, integrations, or working with non-SQL data sources. For example, when we needed to process complex JSON data or interact with APIs, DBT’s rigid structure wasn’t as adaptable as we needed it to be.

Rust, in contrast, provided us with the perfect balance of performance, flexibility, and safety. With Rust’s low-overhead model, we could build a custom ETL pipeline tailored to our needs, processing data quickly without relying on the overhead of a larger framework like Spark. Moreover, Rust’s memory safety and concurrency model made it much easier to scale the solution as the dataset grew.

2.2 Type Checking All the Way Down
One of Rust’s most attractive features is its strict type system, which ensures that errors are caught during development rather than runtime. This is particularly important in ETL pipelines, where data transformation logic can easily become complex and prone to errors if not handled carefully.

For example, when interacting with Postgres, we used sqlx to fetch and map the data into Rust structs. Rust’s strong typing ensured that we could define our data models up-front, and the compiler would catch any issues related to incorrect data types, whether it’s a mismatch between the database schema and the Rust model, or issues with missing or extra columns.

rust
Copy
Edit
#[derive(sqlx::FromRow)]
struct Order {
id: i32,
amount: f64,
customer_id: i32,
}

let orders: Vec<Order> = sqlx::query_as("SELECT id, amount, customer_id FROM orders")
.fetch_all(&pool)
.await?;
This approach eliminated many of the risks associated with SQL queries that could lead to runtime errors or unexpected results. By compiling these queries and data transformations in advance, we ensured that the data pipeline would behave predictably in production.

Rust’s compile-time checks also extended to SQL queries. By using sqlx and Diesel, we were able to map SQL queries directly into Rust code, eliminating the need for runtime string-based queries and allowing the compiler to verify that our SQL logic was correct. This level of type-safety is something that few other languages can provide, giving us peace of mind that our ETL process would work as intended, even as it scaled up.

2.3 The Annoyances
While Rust offered many advantages, it wasn't without its challenges. One of the most significant pain points was managing the frequent Rust version upgrades. As Rust evolves rapidly, some dependencies in our project didn’t always keep pace with the new versions, leading to compatibility issues. This often meant we couldn’t upgrade Rust freely and had to carefully evaluate each new version before adopting it.

For example, when a new version of Rust was released, we had to ensure that our third-party libraries like sqlx and Diesel were compatible with it. This often meant waiting for updates or even patching dependencies ourselves, which could be time-consuming and frustrating.

Another issue was schema management with Diesel. Diesel’s automatic schema generation was convenient but had some drawbacks. Specifically, we didn’t always want to fetch every column from our Postgres database. Diesel generated a schema that would pull in all columns, even those we didn’t need. While we could manually customize the schema, this added complexity to our codebase.

3. A Homemade Cloud-Native ETL
   Building our own custom ETL pipeline from scratch allowed us to gain full control over the process and tailor it specifically to our needs. This section covers the core components of our custom-built ETL pipeline.

3.1 Rust + Diesel Postgres Pagination
Handling large datasets efficiently was one of the major challenges in building our ETL pipeline. Instead of fetching entire tables into memory, we used pagination to break the dataset into smaller, manageable chunks. This allowed us to avoid excessive memory consumption and improve processing speed.

Using Diesel and sqlx, we paginated over large tables in Postgres. Each iteration fetched a limited number of rows, transforming and processing them before moving on to the next chunk. This method not only reduced the load on the database but also minimized the memory footprint.

rust
Copy
Edit
let mut offset = 0;
let limit = 1000;

loop {
let query = format!("SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT {} OFFSET {}", limit, offset);
let orders: Vec<Order> = sqlx::query_as(&query)
.fetch_all(&pool)
.await?;

    if orders.is_empty() {
        break;
    }

    // Process the orders
    offset += limit;
}
This technique, combined with Rust’s async support, allowed us to fetch and process data concurrently, speeding up the overall pipeline and ensuring that we never overloaded memory with large datasets.

3.2 Rust Type Safety
The importance of type safety in Rust can’t be overstated, particularly in the context of ETL pipelines. By enforcing strict typing, we ensured that data transformations were consistent and error-free. This reduced the risk of data corruption or unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with different data sources like Postgres and S3.

Rust’s type system made it easy to define clear and concise data models, ensuring that each field in our database schema was correctly represented in our Rust structs. The compiler would catch any mismatched types before they could cause issues in production.

3.3 Enhancements and Decisions
One of the key advantages of using Rust was the ability to easily integrate with cloud-native tools like S3. Writing data to Parquet files in an optimized manner was crucial for our needs. Using the ParquetRecordWriter, we could stream the transformed data directly to S3, ensuring that we never ran out of memory and that the data was stored efficiently.

We used a custom schema to only include the columns we needed for Parquet files. This way, we weren’t pulling unnecessary columns from Postgres, which could potentially slow down the pipeline. By fine-tuning our data model and schema management, we kept the ETL process efficient and optimized.

4. A Retrospective on What Was Done
   Looking back on the project, it’s clear that building a custom ETL pipeline with Rust was a decision that paid off. The pipeline has been reliable, fast, and secure, and while there were certainly challenges along the way, the benefits far outweighed the downsides.

4.1 What Worked Well
The decision to use Rust was absolutely the right one. Its performance, type safety, and flexibility allowed us to build an ETL pipeline that was both efficient and robust. From streaming data to Parquet to fetching and transforming data from Postgres, Rust gave us everything we needed to process data at scale.

4.2 What Stunk
As with any project, there were some challenges. The schema management with Diesel required some workarounds, and keeping up with Rust version upgrades could be a headache. However, the performance and type safety made it all worth it.

5. Additional Recommendations
   Embrace type safety—Rust’s type system will catch bugs early and keep your pipeline running smoothly.
   Optimize for performance—Rust’s async model allows you to handle large datasets concurrently and efficiently.

    if orders.is_empty() {
        break;
    }

    // Process the orders
    for order in orders {
        // Transform the order data here
    }

    offset += limit;
}

    // Process the data in parallel
    let transform_futures: Vec<_> = orders.into_iter().map(|order| {
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            // Process individual orders here
            transform_order(order).await;
        })
    }).collect();

    // Wait for all tasks to complete
    for future in transform_futures {
        future.await.expect("Failed to process order");
    }
}
