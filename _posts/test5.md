Building a Cloud-Native ETL with Rust: A Retrospective
In this post, I’ll walk you through a cloud-native ETL pipeline built using Rust. Over the years, I’ve worked on various data engineering projects, and this one stands out due to the challenges and decisions we made. From integrating with Postgres to writing to Parquet files on AWS S3, this project centered around performance, type safety, and minimizing operational complexity. Let’s break down the major considerations and how we arrived at our architecture.

1. Data Warehouses: Choosing the Right Backend
   When building a cloud-native ETL pipeline, choosing the right data warehouse to store and process your data is crucial. Here are the key factors we focused on:

1.1 Security
Security was paramount in our design. We ensured that all data transfers were encrypted and adhered to industry-standard security practices for both storage and access control. Using cloud-native solutions like AWS S3 helped us integrate best practices for encryption and access management seamlessly.

1.2 Performance
Performance is essential when dealing with large data pipelines. We designed our data flow to handle high-volume data efficiently. By optimizing our Postgres queries and leveraging Rust’s parallelism capabilities, we ensured quick data processing. Rust’s low-level memory control allowed us to minimize overhead during batch processing.

1.3 Operational Complexity
Managing an ETL pipeline can quickly become overwhelming, especially when scaling. We minimized operational complexity by leveraging Rust’s type safety. Rust’s ability to catch errors at compile-time allowed us to avoid runtime exceptions, streamlining maintenance and reducing the risk of issues in production.

2. Why Rust? The Perfect Language for Cloud-Native ETL
   Rust was an easy choice for this project. Here’s why:

2.1 Type Safety All the Way Down
Unlike languages like Python, where runtime errors are common, Rust ensures type safety from the application layer all the way to table definitions. By pushing error-handling to compile-time, we drastically reduced the chances of runtime failures.

2.2 Performance Considerations
Rust isn’t just safe; it’s also incredibly fast. We were dealing with large datasets, and Rust’s performance is unparalleled in data processing tasks. Moreover, it allowed us to create small executables with minimal memory overhead, perfect for cloud environments.

2.3 The Challenges of Working with Rust
While Rust’s strengths were apparent, working with its ownership and borrowing rules was challenging at times. Handling large data structures and managing memory efficiently required some adjustment. But in the end, the resulting performance and safety justified these hurdles.

3. A Homemade Cloud-Native ETL Pipeline
   Our ETL pipeline was built to run seamlessly on AWS infrastructure. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

3.1 Rust + Diesel for Postgres Pagination
To handle large datasets from Postgres, we used Diesel, a Rust ORM. Diesel allowed us to paginate queries efficiently, fetching data in manageable chunks. This reduced memory usage and prevented timeouts when processing extensive data.

use diesel::prelude::*;
use diesel::pg::PgConnection;
use crate::models::{YourModel, YourModelPaginated};

fn paginate(connection: &PgConnection, offset: i64, limit: i64) -> QueryResult<Vec<YourModel>> {
use crate::schema::your_table::dsl::*;

    your_table
        .limit(limit)
        .offset(offset)
        .load::<YourModel>(connection)
}
3.2 Rust’s Type Safety in the ETL Process
Rust’s type system was invaluable in ensuring data integrity throughout the pipeline. From fetching data from Postgres to writing it into Parquet, we were able to validate data structures at compile-time, ensuring each step was correct before running the pipeline.

3.3 S3 Integration and Parquet Output
The final step in the pipeline involved writing transformed data to AWS S3 in Parquet format. We leveraged the parquet and aws-sdk crates in Rust to perform this efficiently.

rust

use parquet::file::writer::{FileWriter, ParquetWriter};
use aws_sdk_s3::{Client, Region};

async fn write_to_parquet(data: Vec<YourData>, s3_client: &Client, bucket: &str) {
let file_writer = FileWriter::new(&data);
let buffer = file_writer.write_to_buffer();

    s3_client
        .put_object()
        .bucket(bucket)
        .key("transformed_data.parquet")
        .body(buffer.into())
        .send()
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
4. Reflecting on the Project: What Went Right and What Didn’t
   Looking back, the project had its share of wins and challenges.

4.1 Rust Versioning Challenges
One significant obstacle was versioning. We were unable to upgrade to the latest stable Rust version due to compatibility issues with dependencies. This meant that certain advanced features were unavailable, slowing down development at times.

4.2 The Pros and Cons of Diesel ORM
Diesel was largely a great choice, but its automatic schema generation sometimes caused issues, pulling unnecessary columns from Postgres. We mitigated this by defining smaller Diesel schemas, ensuring only the required data was fetched.

4.3 Operational Complexity with a Homemade ETL
While the custom nature of our ETL pipeline gave us flexibility, it came with more maintenance overhead compared to managed services like dbt or Airflow. However, the trade-off for performance and customizability was worthwhile.

5. Conclusion: Lessons Learned and Moving Forward
   Looking back, this project was a rewarding experience. We were able to build a high-performance, secure, and type-safe ETL pipeline that operates efficiently in the cloud. However, we learned that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. The choice of tools often comes down to balancing complexity against functionality.

Going forward, I’m interested in exploring ways to streamline the ETL process further while maintaining the flexibility and performance Rust offers. Additionally, as the data volume grows, it will be important to make the system more resilient and scalable.

Building a Cloud-Native ETL with Rust: A Retrospective
In this post, I will take you through the process of building a cloud-native ETL pipeline using Rust. Over the years, I’ve worked on various data engineering projects, but this particular project stands out due to the unique challenges we faced and the architectural decisions that shaped the final outcome. From integrating with Postgres to writing transformed data to Parquet files on AWS S3, this project was centered around performance, type safety, and minimizing operational complexity. Let’s dive into the critical components of the project and the reasons behind our choices.

1. Data Warehouses: Choosing the Right Backend
   When designing a cloud-native ETL pipeline, selecting the right data warehouse is a crucial decision. Your data warehouse is where all the data is stored and processed, and its design has long-term implications on performance, scalability, and complexity. Below are the key factors we considered when choosing the backend.

1.1 Security
Security is paramount, especially when handling sensitive or regulated data. The nature of our project required that we take a comprehensive approach to security, encompassing both data transfer and storage. We ensured that all data transferred between systems was encrypted using TLS, both for communication with the database (Postgres) and with AWS S3. Additionally, our AWS S3 setup involved the use of server-side encryption (SSE), making sure that data at rest was also securely stored.

To ensure access control, we leveraged IAM roles and policies, restricting access to only the necessary components of the infrastructure. Using services like AWS KMS, we were able to manage encryption keys and ensure compliance with industry standards for data security.

1.2 Performance
In data engineering, performance is a make-or-break factor. The volume of data we needed to process was large, and the speed of processing was critical to meeting our SLAs (Service Level Agreements). Given this, performance optimization was a major design consideration from the beginning.

For database operations, we focused on writing efficient Postgres queries, avoiding full-table scans and unnecessary joins. By indexing the right columns and optimizing our database schema, we ensured that Postgres could handle the high-volume reads and writes efficiently.

On the processing side, Rust provided an edge due to its ability to execute low-level memory optimizations. We made use of Rust's concurrency model to parallelize tasks where appropriate, ensuring we could handle large datasets in chunks without running into memory or performance bottlenecks.

rust
Copy
Edit
use diesel::prelude::*;
use diesel::pg::PgConnection;
use crate::models::{YourModel};

fn paginate(connection: &PgConnection, offset: i64, limit: i64) -> QueryResult<Vec<YourModel>> {
use crate::schema::your_table::dsl::*;

    your_table
        .limit(limit)
        .offset(offset)
        .load::<YourModel>(connection)
}
In this code snippet, we use Diesel to paginate through large datasets. By loading data in manageable chunks, we ensure that memory usage is optimized and prevent timeouts when working with large volumes of data.

1.3 Operational Complexity
Building an ETL pipeline that runs reliably over time can introduce significant operational complexity. We aimed to reduce the operational burden by leveraging Rust's type system, which offered compile-time error checking, making it easier to catch issues early in development.

By focusing on minimizing runtime errors and maximizing compile-time validation, we ensured that errors could be caught early in the pipeline lifecycle. This not only improved reliability but also helped with maintainability in the long term.

rust
Copy
Edit
use std::fs::File;
use parquet::file::writer::{FileWriter, ParquetWriter};
use parquet::schema::types::Type;
use parquet::file::properties::WriterProperties;

fn write_to_parquet(data: Vec<YourModel>, output_file: &str) {
let schema = Type::get_message_type(); // Assume this is predefined schema
let file = File::create(output_file).unwrap();
let mut writer = ParquetWriter::new(file, schema, WriterProperties::builder().build());

    for record in data {
        writer.write(&record).unwrap();
    }
    writer.close().unwrap();
}
In the above code, we implement writing data to Parquet using the parquet crate. By writing the data in this columnar format, we not only ensure efficient storage but also optimize for future querying and transformations.

2. Why Rust? The Perfect Language for Cloud-Native ETL
   Rust’s safety, performance, and concurrency model made it an ideal choice for building the ETL pipeline. Here’s why we chose it:

2.1 Type Safety All the Way Down
One of the standout features of Rust is its type system. In a typical ETL pipeline, data integrity is critical, as data flows through multiple stages, each with different transformations. Rust’s type system ensures that any mistakes in data structure definitions are caught at compile-time, reducing the chances of runtime errors.

When designing the schema, we used Rust structs to represent data in a way that directly mapped to the Postgres tables. This ensured that any issues related to data types or struct definitions were caught before execution.

rust
Copy
Edit
use diesel::Queryable;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Queryable, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct YourModel {
pub id: i32,
pub name: String,
pub amount: f64,
}
By using the #[derive(Queryable)] annotation, we ensured that the YourModel struct mapped directly to the corresponding database table, enabling us to fetch rows from Postgres and work with them in a strongly-typed manner.

2.2 Performance Considerations
Rust was chosen not only for its safety but also for its performance. We were working with large datasets, and processing them efficiently required low-level control over memory usage and parallelism. Rust's ownership system and lack of garbage collection allowed us to write code that minimized memory overhead and ran efficiently even with large datasets.

For example, using Rust’s concurrency features like async and await, we could offload processing tasks to multiple threads, drastically speeding up data processing without running into issues like race conditions or data corruption.

rust
Copy
Edit
use tokio::task;

async fn process_data_chunk(chunk: Vec<YourModel>) {
// Process the chunk of data here
}

async fn process_large_data(data: Vec<YourModel>) {
let chunk_size = 1000;
let tasks: Vec<_> = data.chunks(chunk_size)
.map(|chunk| task::spawn(process_data_chunk(chunk.to_vec())))
.collect();

    for task in tasks {
        task.await.unwrap();
    }
}
This approach enables us to process large chunks of data concurrently, significantly improving performance.

2.3 The Challenges of Working with Rust
While Rust’s performance and safety benefits were undeniable, working with the language wasn’t without its challenges. The ownership model can be difficult to navigate, especially when working with large, complex data structures. Ensuring that data is properly borrowed or owned at all stages of the pipeline can lead to complicated code.

Additionally, the Rust ecosystem, although rich, is still relatively new compared to languages like Python or Java. Some libraries, such as those for handling data formats like Avro or Parquet, required more manual integration than we would have liked.

However, these challenges were worth overcoming. The resulting performance and reliability of the system were far superior to what we could have achieved using other languages.

3. A Homemade Cloud-Native ETL Pipeline
   Building the ETL pipeline from scratch allowed us to have full control over every part of the process. The pipeline was designed to run natively in the cloud, leveraging AWS services such as S3 and RDS for storage and computation.

3.1 Rust + Diesel for Postgres Pagination
Postgres was our choice for storing raw data due to its reliability and scalability. However, since we were dealing with large amounts of data, we had to implement an efficient way to paginate through the data to avoid memory issues or timeouts. Diesel’s support for pagination made it a good fit for this.

rust
Copy
Edit
fn paginate(connection: &PgConnection, offset: i64, limit: i64) -> QueryResult<Vec<YourModel>> {
use crate::schema::your_table::dsl::*;
your_table
.limit(limit)
.offset(offset)
.load::<YourModel>(connection)
}
In this code, we paginate through a table in Postgres, limiting the number of records fetched at once to prevent memory overload. This method ensures that large datasets are processed in manageable chunks.

3.2 Rust’s Type Safety in the ETL Process
Rust’s type system allowed us to write an ETL pipeline that could process data safely and efficiently. We made sure that data validation occurred early in the process, which meant fewer issues in production. Rust’s ability to ensure that data is consistent and correctly typed at every stage of the pipeline helped ensure that we didn’t run into unexpected errors during processing.

rust
Copy
Edit
use crate::models::{YourModel, YourModelParquet};
use parquet::file::writer::{FileWriter, ParquetWriter};
use parquet::schema::types::Type;

fn write_parquet(data: Vec<YourModelParquet>, output_path: &str) {
let file = File::create(output_path).unwrap();
let schema = Type::get_message_type();
let mut writer = ParquetWriter::new(file, schema, WriterProperties::builder().build());

    for record in data {
        writer.write(&record).unwrap();
    }

    writer.close().unwrap();
}
This snippet demonstrates writing transformed data to Parquet, a columnar format that is efficient for both storage and processing.

3.3 S3 Integration and Parquet Output
The final step of the pipeline was storing the processed data in AWS S3 in Parquet format. Parquet’s columnar format is highly optimized for large datasets, and AWS S3 provides a durable, scalable storage solution for cloud-native architectures.

rust
Copy
Edit
use aws_sdk_s3::{Client, Region};

async fn upload_to_s3(data: Vec<u8>, s3_client: &Client, bucket: &str, file_name: &str) {
s3_client.put_object()
.bucket(bucket)
.key(file_name)
.body(data.into())
.send()
.await
.unwrap();
}
In this code, we upload the Parquet file to S3 using the AWS SDK for Rust. The data is uploaded as a byte array, ensuring it is transferred efficiently.

4. Reflecting on the Project: What Went Right and What Didn’t
   As we look back at the project, there are aspects we’re proud of, but also areas where we could have improved.

4.1 Rust Versioning Challenges
One of the major roadblocks we faced was Rust versioning. Due to dependency issues, we couldn’t upgrade to the latest stable Rust version. This limitation meant that some advanced Rust features were unavailable to us, which slowed development at certain points. However, despite this, we were able to work around these issues, and the project was still successful overall.

4.2 The Pros and Cons of Diesel ORM
Diesel was a solid choice for interacting with Postgres, but it wasn’t without its downsides. Diesel’s automatic schema generation sometimes led to us fetching unnecessary columns from the database, which we mitigated by defining smaller schemas that only included the necessary fields.

4.3 Operational Complexity with a Homemade ETL
Building a custom ETL pipeline from scratch gave us the flexibility to tailor it exactly to our needs, but it also added complexity. Compared to managed ETL services like dbt or Airflow, our pipeline required more maintenance and manual intervention. Despite this, the flexibility, performance, and control we gained by building our own pipeline were worth the extra effort.

5. Conclusion: Lessons Learned and Moving Forward
   Reflecting on the project, we are proud of what we accomplished. We built a high-performance, secure, and type-safe ETL pipeline that runs smoothly in the cloud. However, we also learned that no tool is perfect, and the right solution often requires a balance between complexity and functionality.

In the future, we plan to explore ways to further streamline the pipeline while maintaining its flexibility and performance. We also aim to make the system more resilient as the data scales, ensuring that it remains performant and reliable as the dataset grows.
