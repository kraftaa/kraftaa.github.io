Building a Cloud-Native ETL with Rust: A Retrospective
In this post, I'll walk you through a cloud-native ETL pipeline built using Rust. Over the years, I've worked on various data engineering projects, and this one has been particularly interesting because of the challenges and the choices we made. From integrating with Postgres to writing to Parquet files on AWS S3, it all came down to performance, type safety, and minimizing operational complexity. Here’s a breakdown of the major considerations and how we arrived at our current architecture.

1. Data Warehouses: Choosing the Right Backend
   When building a cloud-native ETL pipeline, it's essential to choose the right data warehouse to store and process your data. This section breaks down the key factors involved:

1.1 Security
Security is paramount in any data project, especially when dealing with sensitive information. We ensured all data transfers were encrypted and adhered to industry-standard security practices for both storage and access control.

1.2 Performance
The performance of data pipelines can make or break a system. We carefully designed our data flow to handle large volumes of data while ensuring quick processing times. This meant optimizing our Postgres queries and leveraging efficient Rust libraries for parallelism and batch processing.

1.3 Operational Complexity
Managing an ETL pipeline is no small feat. We aimed to minimize operational complexity by leveraging type safety in Rust and focusing on compile-time validation to catch errors early. This decision helped us avoid runtime exceptions and ensured that errors were caught as close to development as possible.

2. Why Rust? The Perfect Language for Cloud-Native ETL
   Rust was an easy choice for this project. Here’s why:

2.1 Type Safety All the Way Down
In contrast to languages like Python, where runtime errors are common, Rust ensures type safety from the application layer all the way down to table definitions. We made sure to push as much of the error-handling to compile-time as possible, reducing the chance of runtime failures significantly.

2.2 Performance Considerations
Rust was chosen not only for its safety but also for its performance. We were dealing with large datasets, and Rust’s performance is unmatched when it comes to processing and transforming data. Plus, it allows us to create very efficient executables that run with minimal memory overhead.

2.3 The Challenges of Working with Rust
Of course, it hasn’t been all sunshine and rainbows. Rust has its quirks. For instance, working with ownership and borrowing rules when handling large data structures is sometimes painful. But, in the end, these challenges were worth overcoming, as the resulting performance and safety made the effort worthwhile.

3. A Homemade Cloud-Native ETL Pipeline
   Our ETL pipeline was built to be fully cloud-native, running seamlessly on AWS infrastructure. Here’s a high-level overview of how it works:

3.1 Rust + Diesel for Postgres Pagination
We needed to handle large datasets from Postgres. Diesel, a Rust ORM, was a good fit for managing database connections. With Diesel, we were able to use efficient pagination techniques to fetch large amounts of data in chunks, minimizing memory usage and preventing timeouts.

3.2 Rust’s Type Safety in the ETL Process
Rust’s type system allowed us to ensure that data flowed through the pipeline in a well-defined manner. Whether it was fetching data from Postgres or writing to Parquet, we were able to validate the data structures at compile-time, ensuring that every step of the process was correct before runtime.

3.3 S3 Integration and Parquet Output
The final step in the pipeline was writing the transformed data to AWS S3 as Parquet files. Using libraries like parquet and s3 crates in Rust, we ensured that the files were stored efficiently and securely.

4. Reflecting on the Project: What Went Right and What Didn’t
   As we look back on the project, there are a few things we would have done differently, but also plenty of aspects we’re proud of.

4.1 Rust Versioning Challenges
One of the hurdles we faced was versioning. We couldn’t upgrade our Rust version to the latest stable release due to dependency issues. This limitation meant that some of the newer, more advanced features of Rust were unavailable to us, which slowed down certain development tasks.

4.2 The Pros and Cons of the Diesel ORM
While Diesel was a great choice overall, it wasn’t without its downsides. One of the biggest challenges was its automatic schema generation, which sometimes led to pulling in unnecessary columns from the Postgres database. To mitigate this, we created smaller Diesel schemas, ensuring that we only loaded the data we truly needed.

4.3 Operational Complexity with a Homemade ETL
As much as we benefited from type safety and the power of Rust, there were still moments of frustration. The custom nature of our pipeline meant more maintenance overhead compared to using a managed service like dbt or Airflow. However, the benefits in terms of performance and flexibility outweighed these challenges.

5. Conclusion: Lessons Learned and Moving Forward
   Looking back, this project was a rewarding experience that taught us a lot about the power of Rust in data engineering. We were able to build a high-performance, secure, and type-safe ETL pipeline that runs efficiently in the cloud. However, we also learned that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution, and sometimes choosing the right tools requires balancing trade-offs between complexity and functionality.

In the future, I would like to explore more ways to streamline the ETL pipeline while keeping the flexibility and performance that Rust provides. Additionally, I plan to investigate how we can make the system more resilient to scaling challenges as the data grows.

Summary
Problem:


This project started several years ago to fill the gap in providing data for company reporting in the absence of an ETL process. The production data resided in a Postgres RDS instance, but running reports directly on it was not an option due to performance and security concerns. Postgres was great for transactional workloads, but the complex computations and aggregations required for reporting were costly in terms of performance.

Challenges:
Security: We did not want to expose the Postgres instance to other services or users.
Performance: Complex queries were slowing down the main application.
Operational Complexity: Merging data from multiple sources was resulting in overly complex schemas and hard-to-maintain queries.
Cost: Scaling the Postgres instance to handle heavy ETL processes was expensive.
The Solution:
We built a cloud-native ETL pipeline using Rust, AWS S3, AWS Glue, and AWS Athena.

ETL Overview:
The ETL pipeline was designed to read data from Postgres, transform it in Rust, and store the results in S3 as Parquet files. These files are then crawled by AWS Glue and queried via AWS Athena for reporting.

Rust Program:
The Rust program plays a crucial role in the ETL process, fetching data from Postgres, performing transformations (including derived fields and joins), and storing the output in Parquet format. Rust’s strong type system ensured data integrity throughout the process.

Rust for Performance and Type Safety: The program leveraged Rust’s type-checking to prevent errors related to data inconsistencies, ensuring that production data integrity was maintained.
Kubernetes Deployment: The Rust program was deployed using Helm in a Kubernetes environment, with the service account configured to interact with AWS services securely.
Parquet Files on S3:
Data transformations were stored in S3 in Parquet format, which helped reduce storage costs and improve query efficiency.

AWS Glue + Athena:
AWS Glue was used to crawl the Parquet files and create the metadata necessary for querying them with AWS Athena. Athena provided a cost-effective way to query large datasets using SQL, albeit with some limitations (e.g., lack of indexing and materialized views).

Rust Program:
Members:
The Rust program was structured using multiple workspaces in Cargo, each dedicated to a different component of the project:

]
Why This Project Structure?
The project was structured this way to allow independent management of components, which made building and optimizing each crate easier. This also enabled parallel builds using Cargo’s workspace features.

Schema:
The Postgres tables were mapped to Rust structs using Diesel’s table! macro. This was initially done manually but was later automated using a combination of bash scripts and the diesel_ext crate 

To refactor the process into a combined Bash script that automatically generates the table macros and structs, as well as creating corresponding tasks with the required calculations, I’ll walk you through how to handle each part:

Refactor Goal:
Table Macros: The Bash script will iterate over a predefined list of tables and generate the corresponding _table!_ macros for Diesel schema definitions.
Structs: The script will generate Rust struct files for each table.
Tasks: The script will create task files that combine data from the tables and add calculated fields.
Assumptions:
The predefined list of tables exists.
The Bash script will generate table! macros and corresponding struct definitions automatically.
The script will also generate tasks that combine data and perform calculations.
Steps:
Define the List of Tables: We’ll define a list of tables to iterate over. For each table, we will generate:

A Diesel table! macro for schema definitions.
A corresponding Rust struct for data mapping.
A task file to combine and perform calculations on the data.
Bash Script: The script will handle the generation of these files in the right directories.

Example Bash Script:
bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash

# Predefined list of tables (just an example)
TABLES=("orders" "users" "products")

# Directories
TABLE_DIR="project_schemas/src/tables"
MODEL_DIR="project_schemas/src/models"
TASK_DIR="project_tasks/src/tasks"

# Function to generate the table macro for Diesel schema
generate_table_macro() {
local table=$1
cat <<EOF > "$TABLE_DIR/${table}_tl.rs"
table! {
${table} (id) {
id -> Int4,
user_id -> Nullable<Int4>,
amount -> Nullable<BigDecimal>,
created_at -> Nullable<Timestamp>,
uuid -> Uuid,
}
}
EOF
echo "Generated table macro for ${table}"
}

# Function to generate the struct for the table
generate_struct() {
local table=$1
cat <<EOF > "$MODEL_DIR/${table}.rs"
use uuid::Uuid;
use bigdecimal::BigDecimal;
use chrono::NaiveDateTime;

#[derive(Queryable, Debug)]
pub struct ${table^} {
pub id: i32,
pub user_id: Option<i32>,
pub amount: f64,
pub created_at: Option<NaiveDateTime>,
pub uuid: Uuid,
}
EOF
echo "Generated struct for ${table}"
}

# Function to generate the task that combines data and adds calculations
generate_task() {
local table=$1
cat <<EOF > "$TASK_DIR/combined_${table}.rs"
use super::prelude::*;
use project_schemas::tables::${table}::dsl as ${table}_dsl;
use std::collections::HashMap;

pub fn process_${table}() {
// Perform your calculations here and combine data as needed.
println!("Processing ${table}");
// Example of calculation
let result = ${table}_dsl::amount.sum();
println!("Total amount: {:?}", result);
}
EOF
echo "Generated task for ${table}"
}

# Iterate over the predefined list of tables
for table in "${TABLES[@]}"; do
generate_table_macro "$table"
generate_struct "$table"
generate_task "$table"
done

echo "All tables processed successfully."
How It Works:
Define Tables: The TABLES array contains the names of the tables. You can expand or modify this array as per your project’s needs.

Generate Diesel table! Macros: The generate_table_macro function creates a Diesel schema definition file for each table. It uses the table! macro to define the table and columns (you might need to modify the field types depending on your table schema).

Generate Structs: The generate_struct function creates a Rust struct for each table, mapping the database columns to Rust data types.

Generate Task Files: The generate_task function generates a task that can access the schema, perform necessary calculations, and process the data.

Iteration: The script iterates over the list of tables, calling the functions to generate the necessary files for each table.

Example Output:
After running the script, you will have the following files generated:

Table Macros (project_schemas/src/tables/orders_tl.rs):

rust

Edit
table! {
orders (id) {
id -> Int4,
user_id -> Nullable<Int4>,
amount -> Nullable<BigDecimal>,
created_at -> Nullable<Timestamp>,
uuid -> Uuid,
}
}
Struct (project_schemas/src/models/orders.rs):

rust
Copy
Edit
use uuid::Uuid;
use bigdecimal::BigDecimal;
use chrono::NaiveDateTime;

#[derive(Queryable, Debug)]
pub struct Order {
pub id: i32,
pub user_id: Option<i32>,
pub amount: f64,
pub created_at: Option<NaiveDateTime>,
pub uuid: Uuid,
}
Task (project_tasks/src/tasks/combined_orders.rs):

rust
Copy
Edit
use super::prelude::*;
use project_schemas::tables::orders::dsl as orders_dsl;
use std::collections::HashMap;

pub fn process_orders() {
// Perform your calculations here and combine data as needed.
println!("Processing orders");
// Example of calculation
let result = orders_dsl::amount.sum();
println!("Total amount: {:?}", result);
}
Customization:
Field Types: Depending on your actual schema, modify the field types in the generate_table_macro function to match your actual Postgres table definitions.
Tasks Logic: The generate_task function should be expanded to perform the necessary calculations and combine data as per your project requirements.
This approach should allow you to easily manage and scale your task and struct generation for many tables without manually writing each file.

Overview of Code Functionality
Re-exporting Module Contents:

rust
Copy
Edit
pub use self::combined_orders::*;
This line re-exports all public items from the combined_orders module, allowing them to be accessed via the parent module. This pattern is common in module hierarchies, enabling a clean interface by selectively exposing submodule contents.

Imports in combined_orders.rs:

rust
Copy
Edit
use std::collections::HashMap;
This imports the HashMap type from the Rust standard library.

rust
Copy
Edit
use project_schemas::tables::{ ... };
Imports specific modules from project_schemas::tables and sets up aliases for easier use.

Using Diesel DSL for SQL Queries:

rust
Copy
Edit
orders::dsl as orders_dsl
This imports the DSL (domain-specific language) from the orders table module and renames it as orders_dsl for convenience. Diesel's DSL provides helper types and macros to construct SQL queries.

Defining the Output Struct:

rust
Copy
Edit
#[derive(ParquetRecordWriter)]
struct CombinedOrderRecord {
order_id: i32,
user_id: Option<i32>,
country: String,
currency: String,
conversion_rate: f64,
user_email: Option<String>,
amount: f64,
amount_usd: f64,
amount_with_tax: f64,
created_at: Option<NaiveDateTime>,
}
The ParquetRecordWriter trait is automatically derived for the CombinedOrderRecord struct, enabling writing to Parquet format.

The Task Function:

rust
Copy
Edit
pub fn combined_orders(pg_uri: &str) -> (String, i64) {
let conn = PgConnection::establish(pg_uri).unwrap();
let orders_load = Instant::now();
let orders = orders_dsl::orders.load::<Order>(&conn).unwrap();
trace!("load orders took: {:?}", orders_load.elapsed());
}
This function establishes a PostgreSQL connection and loads data from the orders table using Diesel.
The unwrap() call ensures the program panics if the query fails (often used in development for clarity but discouraged in production).
Handling Query Results:

Instead of unwrap(), consider using expect() to provide a more descriptive panic message:

rust
Copy
Edit
let orders = orders_dsl::orders
.load::<Order>(&conn)
.expect("Failed to load orders from the database");
Or handle errors gracefully:

rust
Copy
Edit
let orders = match orders_dsl::orders.load::<Order>(&conn) {
Ok(orders) => orders,
Err(e) => {
eprintln!("Error loading orders: {}", e);
return Err(e);
}
};
Avoid: Returning empty data as a fallback, which could silently mask issues:

rust
Copy
Edit
let orders = orders_dsl::orders
.load::<Product>(&conn)
.unwrap_or_else(|e| {
eprintln!("Error loading orders: {}", e);
Vec::new()
});
Using the ? Operator for Error Propagation:

The ? operator propagates errors up the call stack without causing a panic:

rust
Copy
Edit
let orders = orders_dsl::orders.load::<Order>(&conn)?;
Logging Query Time:

rust
Copy
Edit
let users_load = Instant::now();
let users = users_dsl::users.load::<User>(&conn).unwrap();
trace!("load users took: {:?}", users_load.elapsed());
The Instant::now() call starts a stopwatch, and the elapsed() method measures the query execution time. You can print the elapsed time in various units (milliseconds, seconds, microseconds).

Extracting Specific Columns:

To collect all user_id and order_id values from the orders table:

rust
Copy
Edit
let orders_ids: Vec<i32> = orders.iter().map(|x| x.id).collect();
let users_ids: Vec<i32> = orders.iter().filter_map(|x| x.user_id).collect();
Loading and Mapping the currencies Table:

rust
Copy
Edit
let currencies: Vec<Currency> = currencies_dsl::currencies
.filter(currencies_dsl::type.eq("Order"))
.filter(currencies_dsl::type_id.eq(any(&orders_ids[..])))
.load::<Currency>(&conn)
.unwrap();
This filters the currencies table to only include rows with a type of "Order" and a type_id that matches any of the orders_ids.

Creating a Lookup Table:

rust
Copy
Edit
let currencies_by_order_id: HashMap<i32, &Currency> = currencies
.iter()
.map(|x| (x.type_id.unwrap(), x))
.collect();
This creates a HashMap where the keys are order_id (unwrapped type_id) and the values are references to the corresponding Currency objects.

Filtering and Transforming Data:

rust
Copy
Edit
let parquet_records: Vec<CombinedOrderRecord> = orders
.iter()
.filter(|order| order.user_id.is_some())
.filter(|order| order.active)
.map(|o| {
// Mapping logic here
})
This filters orders with a user_id and active status before mapping each order to a CombinedOrderRecord.

To summarize your approach and refactor your code efficiently, the goal is to manage the extraction and processing of conversion_rate from the currency object, while addressing Rust ownership rules and avoiding unnecessary cloning. Here's an improved and more concise version of your explanation and code.

Refactored Code:
Instead of using .clone() and map separately, you can leverage and_then for cleaner, more idiomatic Rust:

rust
Copy
Edit
let conversion_rate = currency
.and_then(|x| x.conversion_rate)  // Extract the conversion_rate if currency exists
.map(|cr| cr.to_f64().expect("Failed to convert BigDecimal to f64")) // Convert to f64
.unwrap_or(1.0);  // Default value if no conversion_rate is available
Why Use and_then Instead of map:
and_then: It extracts the conversion_rate directly if it exists (i.e., Option<BigDecimal>), allowing you to chain further operations (like the conversion to f64) without needing to explicitly unwrap or clone. It avoids the need for using clone() because we are working with references.
map: It is typically used when you already have a value (not an Option) and want to apply a function to it. However, in this case, and_then is cleaner because you are dealing with nested Option types (Option<Option<BigDecimal>>).
Why Avoid clone():
Rust Ownership: In the original version, calling .clone() was required to avoid moving ownership of conversion_rate, which is of type Option<BigDecimal>. Since BigDecimal does not implement Copy, using clone() ensures that you don't move ownership and can continue to use it later in your program.
Using as_ref(): You correctly pointed out that you can use as_ref() to borrow the inner value instead of cloning it, which is a more efficient approach:
rust
Copy
Edit
let conversion_rate = currency
.as_ref() // Borrow the Option<Currency> rather than moving it
.and_then(|x| x.conversion_rate.as_ref()) // Borrow the BigDecimal value
.map(|cr| cr.to_f64().expect("Failed to convert BigDecimal to f64")) // Convert to f64
.unwrap_or(1.0); // Default value
This is more efficient because it avoids unnecessary cloning and instead borrows the conversion_rate, retaining the original value for future use.

Refactoring for tax_rate and user_email:
Similar principles apply for extracting tax_rate and user_email:

rust
Copy
Edit
let tax_rate = taxes
.and_then(|x| x.rate.as_ref())  // Extract tax rate as reference
.map(|cr| cr.to_f64().expect("Failed to convert tax rate to f64"))
.unwrap_or(0.0);  // Default if no tax rate available

let user_email = user
.map(|u| u.email.clone())  // Clone email if User exists
.unwrap_or_else(|| "default@example.com".to_string());  // Default email
For the user_email, since String does not implement Copy, you would need to clone it explicitly when extracting it from the Option<User>. However, if you're just working with &str, you could avoid cloning.

Writing to Parquet:
After processing and collecting your CombinedOrderRecord entries into a Vec, the steps to write to Parquet remain mostly the same. However, I’ll highlight the simplified, clearer version:

rust
Copy
Edit
let path = "/tmp/combined_orders.parquet";
let mut count = 0;

let schema = parquet_records.as_slice().schema().unwrap();
println!("{:?} schema", &schema);

let file = std::fs::File::create(&path).unwrap();
let mut pfile = SerializedFileWriter::new(file, schema, props()).unwrap();

let mut row_group = pfile.next_row_group().unwrap();
(&parquet_records[..])
.write_to_row_group(&mut row_group)
.expect("can't 'write_to_row_group'");
pfile.close_row_group(row_group).unwrap();
count += 1;

println!("{} count", count);

pfile.close().unwrap();
Key Takeaways:
Avoiding unnecessary cloning: By leveraging as_ref() and and_then(), you can avoid unnecessary cloning of Option and BigDecimal, reducing memory overhead and improving efficiency.
Error handling: Use expect() with meaningful messages to clarify which part of the conversion is failing (e.g., "Failed to convert BigDecimal to f64").
Consistency: For extracting optional values like user_email, tax_rate, and conversion_rate, use consistent patterns like and_then(), map(), and unwrap_or() to handle missing values or errors gracefully.

Trait Definition: ProjectTask
The ProjectTask trait defines a shared interface for task types that must:

Be thread-safe (Sync and Send).
Be safe across unwind boundaries (RefUnwindSafe and UnwindSafe).
Provide a run function that takes a PostgreSQL connection string (postgres_uri) and returns a tuple (String, i64).
Streaming Tasks
Initially, we used Diesel to handle small-to-medium-sized tables. However, as we began working with large datasets, we faced memory and RDS connection issues due to loading everything into memory at once. To address this, we switched to using sqlx for asynchronous, non-blocking database access to stream large tables from PostgreSQL and write results to Parquet.

Why sqlx Over Diesel for Large Tables?
Asynchronous Access: sqlx supports async/await, allowing non-blocking database operations, which improves throughput and scalability, especially with large datasets. Diesel is synchronous, which can block the main thread and cause performance bottlenecks.

Efficient Data Streaming: Using sqlx::query_as and .fetch(&pool), we can stream results in chunks, avoiding the memory overhead of loading the entire dataset into memory.

Compile-Time SQL Checking: sqlx verifies SQL queries at compile time, offering better type safety and performance optimization. Diesel requires more complex query-building and lacks full async support.

Flexible Dynamic Queries: With sqlx, constructing dynamic queries based on runtime conditions is simpler. We can directly append conditions to a query string. Diesel’s ORM-like approach is more rigid and requires writing extra code for every additional filter condition.

Dynamic Query Construction Example
In sqlx, constructing a query based on dynamic filters is straightforward:

rust
Copy
Edit
async fn fetch_users(pool: &PgPool, filters: HashMap<&str, &str>) -> Result<Vec<User>> {
let mut query = "SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE 1=1".to_string();

    if let Some(min_date) = filters.get("min_date") {
        query.push_str(&format!(" AND date >= '{}'", min_date));
    }

    let exclude_domains = vec!["example.com", "example2.com"];
    for domain in &exclude_domains {
        query.push_str(&format!(" AND email NOT LIKE '%@{}'", domain));
    }

    let users = sqlx::query_as::<_, User>(&query).fetch_all(pool).await?;
    Ok(users)
}
This approach is simple and flexible because additional conditions can be appended dynamically, without worrying about query formatting or creating multiple query variants.

In contrast, Diesel requires more boilerplate for dynamic queries:

rust
Copy
Edit
fn fetch_users(conn: &PgConnection, user_name: Option<&str>, user_email: Option<&str>) -> Vec<User> {
let mut query = users.into_boxed(); // Allows dynamic query construction

    if let Some(name) = user_name {
        query = query.filter(name.eq(name));
    }

    if let Some(email) = user_email {
        query = query.filter(email.eq(email));
    }

    query.load::<User>(conn).expect("Error loading users")
}
Each new filter in Diesel requires additional code, while with sqlx, we simply append conditions.

sqlx vs Diesel Advantages
sqlx allows flexible, string-based query construction without predefined schema definitions.
Supports building dynamic queries based on user input without needing to write multiple query versions.
Diesel requires predefined schema mappings, which can be restrictive for dynamic queries.
Using sqlx::FromRow and ParquetRecordWriter
We define the ProjectStreamTask trait for asynchronous tasks that interact with PostgreSQL and return results. This trait ensures that implementing types are thread-safe and error-resistant.

rust
Copy
Edit
#[async_trait]
pub trait ProjectStreamTask: Debug + Sync + Send + RefUnwindSafe + UnwindSafe {
async fn run(&self, postgres_uri: &str) -> (String, i64);
}
In the streaming_task.rs file, ProductRecordStream is used with ParquetRecordWriter and sqlx::FromRow to enable automatic schema extraction and data mapping from PostgreSQL to Rust structs.

The sqlx::FromRow derive macro maps the database query results directly into ProductRecordStream, allowing SQLx to deserialize rows into Rust structs efficiently.

Why Use a Placeholder Struct?
We use a placeholder struct (ProductRecordStream) with Default::default() to introspect its schema. This struct helps dynamically build SQL queries based on the struct’s fields (which map to database columns). This avoids hardcoding column names, making the query generation more flexible and resilient to schema changes.

The placeholder struct allows us to extract schema details like field names, which are essential for building SQL queries dynamically.

Extracting Schema Information
By creating a fake instance of ProductRecordStream, we can extract schema metadata dynamically:

rust
Copy
Edit
let fake_products = vec![ProductRecordStream { ..Default::default() }];
let schema = fake_products.as_slice().schema().unwrap();
let schema_vec = schema.get_fields();
This ensures that the SQL query adapts to the struct’s fields without manual updates.

Handling Ownership and Borrowing Issues
Rust’s ownership and borrowing rules can make working with schema introspection tricky. For instance:

rust
Copy
Edit
let schema = fake_products.as_slice().schema().unwrap();
let schema_vec = schema.get_fields(); // Borrowing `schema` here

// Later, we try to move `schema` into `SerializedFileWriter`
// which causes a conflict because `schema` has already been borrowed.
let mut pfile = SerializedFileWriter::new(file, schema, props()).unwrap();
To resolve these issues, we either need to clone schema or adjust our borrowing strategy to ensure that we don’t inadvertently move data while it’s still being used.

Field Name Construction for SQL Queries
We iterate over the schema fields and dynamically generate SQL-compatible field names:

rust
Copy
Edit
let mut fields: Vec<&str> = vec![];
for field in schema_vec {
if field.name() == "uuid" {
fields.push("uuid::varchar"); // Special handling for UUID type
} else {
fields.push(field.name());
}
}
This approach adapts to different field types and generates SQL-friendly field names, ensuring compatibility with the database.

let mut chunk_stream = product_stream.map(|fs| fs.unwrap()).chunks(5000);
while let Some(chunks) = chunk_stream.next().await {
let mut row_group = parquet_writer.next_row_group().unwrap();

Refactored Task Implementation
rust
Copy
Edit
use async_trait::async_trait;

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct ProductStreamTask;

Explanation of Changes:
Refactored Parquet Writing: The create_parquet_writer function abstracts the logic of creating the Parquet file writer with the desired properties, ensuring better code reuse and error handling.

SQL Query Construction: The construct_query function abstracts the logic of dynamically constructing a SELECT query, making it more readable and testable.

Query Execution: The execute_query function is simplified to return a stream, encapsulating the query logic.

Data Processing: The process_data_chunk function is refactored to handle the chunking and writing of rows to the Parquet file more cleanly, reducing redundancy and improving clarity.

Task Implementation: The ProductStreamTask now uses #[async_trait] to define the run method asynchronously, adhering to the desired task pattern.

Additional Improvements:
Error Handling: We use .expect() for error handling in critical areas (like file creation and writer initialization), but you could enhance this by handling errors more gracefully, possibly using Result or Option types.
Code Organization: The functions have been modularized into small, reusable units, improving the maintainability and testability of the code.
Explanation of Sync, Send, RefUnwindSafe, and UnwindSafe in Rust
These traits ensure that the types used are safe to share and mutate across threads or panic boundaries:

Send: Indicates that ownership of a type can be transferred safely between threads. Types like i32 and Vec<T> are Send by default, while non-thread-safe types like Rc<T> are not.

Sync: Indicates that a reference to a type can be safely shared across threads. For example, Arc<T> is Sync because it allows shared ownership across threads.

RefUnwindSafe: Ensures that a type can be safely accessed by reference across a panic boundary, meaning it remains in a valid state if a panic occurs.

UnwindSafe: Ensures that a type can be safely used during unwinding (i.e., when cleaning up after a panic), ensuring resources are properly released and the program can recover.

In your task, Sync, Send, RefUnwindSafe, and UnwindSafe traits are required for types involved in concurrent tasks to ensure that data can be accessed or transferred across threads or during panic handling without causing undefined behavior or memory safety issues.

Example of Thread Safety
Here's how Arc can be used for thread-safe shared ownership:

rust
Copy
Edit
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

let data = Arc::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);

let handle = thread::spawn({
let data = Arc::clone(&data);
move || {
println!("{:?}", data); // Safe because `Arc` is both `Send` and `Sync`
}
});

handle.join().unwrap();
This pattern ensures that the data can be safely shared across threads, and each thread gets its own reference. The Arc ensures thread-safe reference counting, allowing multiple threads to read from the same data without issues.

In contrast, using Rc would not work in this case, as it's not thread-safe:

rust
Copy
Edit
use std::rc::Rc;

let data = Rc::new(vec![1, 2, 3]); // Rc is not thread-safe!
let handle = thread::spawn({
let data = Rc::clone(&data);
move || {
println!("{:?}", data); // This would panic!
}
});
This will panic because Rc is not designed for sharing across threads.

To refactor the SerializedFileWriter trait implementation, the main goal is to improve readability, handle the fact that total_num_rows is now a private field, and potentially allow for alternative ways to calculate or track the number of rows.

Here's a refactor that eliminates the need to rely on the total_num_rows field directly by creating a proxy or getter method and considering the loss of direct access:

rust
Copy
Edit
// Assuming that we no longer have access to the `total_num_rows` field directly, we can implement a
// custom method for keeping track of row counts or calculating it dynamically.
impl<W: ParquetWriter> FileWriterRows for SerializedFileWriter<W> {
fn total_num_rows(&mut self) -> &i64 {
// As the field is now private, we may need to compute the row count dynamically
// or return a fixed value if it is not accessible (or cached elsewhere).

        // In this case, we assume a placeholder value until we figure out an alternative:
        &self.cached_row_count // This would be a new field we manage ourselves, potentially cached.
    }
    
    // Optionally, a method to update row count:
    fn update_row_count(&mut self, rows: i64) {
        self.cached_row_count = rows;
    }
}
Explanation of changes:
total_num_rows Method:

Previously, this directly referenced the total_num_rows field, which was public. Now that it's private, we've replaced it with a proxy method that can either compute the count dynamically (if possible) or return a cached value.
The cached_row_count is a placeholder field to track the row count manually if it can't be fetched directly from the internal state.
Row Count Updates (update_row_count):

Since we no longer have direct access to the field, we may choose to add a method to manage or update this field ourselves. This method could be called wherever the row count is updated in your logic.
If the row count is stored externally (like in a variable or cache), this method ensures it gets updated with the correct value.
Caveat:
The actual implementation will depend on how you decide to manage or track the row count. If it's entirely dependent on the SerializedFileWriter<W> type (e.g., if the count needs to be derived from the written data), the method could be more complex and might require further changes in how SerializedFileWriter<W> manages its state internally.
This change keeps the existing interface intact while allowing flexibility in managing the row count without direct access to private fields.
